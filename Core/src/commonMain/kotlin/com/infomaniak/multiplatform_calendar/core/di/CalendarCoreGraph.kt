/**
 * Shared contract for the Calendar dependency graph.

 * Automatically merged as a supertype of any `@DependencyGraph(AppScope::class)`:
 * - On Android: merged into the app's `AppGraph`
 * - On Apple: merged into `CalendarSDK`
 *
 * Platform-specific graphs only need to provide the [android.content.Context] (Android)
 * or the database path (Apple) — everything else is wired through `@Inject` classes
 * and `@ContributesTo` modules (`DatabaseModule`, `AndroidDatabaseModule`, `CaldavClientModule`).
