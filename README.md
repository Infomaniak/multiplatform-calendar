### Modules

| Module     | Purpose                                                                                        |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Core**   | Public API: domain models, Room database, DAOs, repositories, managers, Apple `CalendarSDK`   |
| **kmpdav** | Internal bridge: Rust/UniFFI CalDAV bridge, remote CalDAV models/client, `CaldavClientModule` |

### XCFramework

The `KmpCalendar.xcframework` is produced by the **Core module**. `:kmpdav` is a plain `implementation` dependency
(not exported): the public Apple API only exposes Core-owned types — e.g. credentials are passed as the Core
`DavCredentials` (mapped to the internal `:kmpdav` `DavAccount` at the repository boundary). The only `:kmpdav` symbol
left in the generated header is an **empty** `CaldavClientModule` marker protocol that `CalendarSDK` must conform to for
DI (see the DI note below); no `:kmpdav` data type is exposed.

Apple consumers import `KmpCalendar` and access the SDK through:

```swift
import KmpCalendar

let sdk = CalendarSDKProvider.shared.sdk
sdk.accountManager.initAccount(...)
sdk.calendarManager.observeCalendars(...)
```

### DI (Metro)

- **Android**: `AppGraph` (in the Android app) is the `@DependencyGraph`. Core contributes shared graph accessors
  (`CalendarCoreGraph`) plus `AndroidDatabaseModule` and `DatabaseModule`. The `:kmpdav` module contributes `CaldavClientModule`.
- **Apple**: `CalendarSDK` (in `Core/appleMain`) is the public `@DependencyGraph`. It provides the Apple Room database,
  inherits `CalendarCoreGraph` explicitly to export `accountManager` / `calendarManager`, and inherits `:kmpdav`'s
  `CaldavClientModule` explicitly to obtain the CalDAV bridge binding. It is accessed via `CalendarSDKProvider.shared.sdk`.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You are using a Linux, macOS, or Windows machine.
- You have installed Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or later.
- You have Android Studio installed.
- You have [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) installed with cross-compilation targets:
  ```bash
  rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android \
                     aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim aarch64-apple-darwin
  ```
- You have an active internet connection to download project dependencies.

## Rust CalDAV Bridge

The `kmpdav/rust/caldav_bridge` crate provides CalDAV operations (discover calendars, CRUD events) via [fast-dav-rs](https://github.com/Goopil/fast-dav-rs).
iCalendar data is parsed into typed fields using the [icalendar](https://docs.rs/icalendar) crate, and extra WebDAV
collection properties (privileges, owner, color) via [roxmltree](https://docs.rs/roxmltree) (see *Extra CalDAV properties* below).

The Rust → Kotlin/Swift bridge is handled automatically by [Gobley](https://github.com/aspect-build/gobley) + [UniFFI](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/) — no manual JNI, cinterop, or JSON serialization needed.

```
Kotlin/Swift  ←──UniFFI bindings──→  Rust lib.rs  →  fast-dav-rs (CalDAV)  →  icalendar (parsing)
```

Rust compilation and binding generation are integrated into the Gradle build via the `dev.gobley.cargo` and `dev.gobley.uniffi` plugins. No separate build step is required — just run `./gradlew assembleDebug`.

### Extra CalDAV properties

`fast-dav-rs` only surfaces a fixed subset of collection properties. When we need others — the `current-user-privilege-set`
(RFC 3744, mapped to a `CalendarAccessLevel`), the `DAV:owner`, or the Apple `calendar-color` — the crate issues its own
`Depth: 1` PROPFIND and parses the multistatus with [roxmltree](https://docs.rs/roxmltree) (see `rust/caldav_bridge/src/props.rs`).
Parsing matches on **local names** so it is agnostic to the server's namespace prefix, and is **best-effort**: a missing or
unsupported property never breaks calendar discovery. To fetch a new property, add it to `PROPS_BODY` and to `CollectionProps`.

### Rust build profiles & binary size

The Rust artifacts are **huge in debug and small in release** — always compare like-for-like:

| Artifact                        | Debug      | Release       |
|---------------------------------|------------|---------------|
| Android `.so` (per ABI, shipped)| ~66–77 MB  | **~4.8 MB**   |
| Apple `.a` (per slice)          | ~140 MB    | **~14 MB**    |

The `.a` static archive is **never shipped**: only the linked, stripped `.so` (Android) or the framework binary (Apple) goes
into the app. The release profile (`lto`, `opt-level = "s"`, `strip`) is configured in `rust/caldav_bridge/Cargo.toml`.

> ⚠️ Do **not** set `panic = "abort"`: UniFFI relies on catching Rust panics to convert them into FFI errors; aborting would
> crash the app instead.

**Profile selection per consumer (Gobley):**

- **Android** — follows the AGP build type automatically: `assembleDebug` → Rust `dev` profile, `assembleRelease` /
  `bundleRelease` → Rust `release` profile. Nothing to configure.
- **Apple / Kotlin-Native** — ⚠️ **gotcha**: the Rust static lib is embedded at **cinterop** time, which is *variant-agnostic*
  (a single klib), and Gobley defaults the native build to **`Debug`**. So `assembleKmpCalendarReleaseXCFramework` would
  otherwise link the ~140 MB **debug** `.a` into the *release* XCFramework (a ~250 MB zip). To force a release native Rust
  build, pass `-PrustNativeRelease=true` (already wired into `buildRelease`):

  ```bash
  ./gradlew :Core:assembleKmpCalendarReleaseXCFramework -PrustNativeRelease=true
  ```

  This is opt-in so day-to-day Apple builds keep a debug Rust (faster rebuilds, native debug symbols).

  **Static framework keeps DWARF** — the Apple framework is *static* (`isStatic = true`), i.e. an unlinked `ar` archive, so
  both the Kotlin and Rust objects keep their debug info (`__DWARF`) even in release (Cargo's `strip` only applies to *linked*
  binaries like the Android `.so`, not to static `.a`). That is ~30% of dead weight per slice (e.g. iosArm64: 31 MB → 22 MB).
  `buildRelease` therefore runs `strip -S` (+ `ranlib`) on each XCFramework slice before zipping; `strip -S` removes the debug
  sections while keeping the global symbols required for linking.

**Build the app in debug but Rust in release** (small/optimized native lib in a debug app): repoint the `debug` Cargo
variant to the `release` profile in `kmpdav/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
import gobley.gradle.cargo.profiles.CargoProfile

cargo {
    packageDirectory = layout.projectDirectory.dir("rust/caldav_bridge")
    debug.profile = CargoProfile.Release
}
```
